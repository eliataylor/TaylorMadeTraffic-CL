<h4>HVFIR Project: Torque and Ohm Resistance Validator</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Built Angular / Node-Red interface to tell direct operator to each fastener, in their proper order, & indicate when in-position to trigger the tool, and whether results were a pass or fail</li>
    <li>Wrote strict data validation on torque and resistance values in order to allow operator to proceed or readjust fastener.</li>
    <li>Wrote MySQL queries to get required settings for each step of the assembly process</li>
    <li>Wrote MySQL queries to record results of each attempt to fasten</li>
</ul>
<h4>Assembly line job builder and progress monitoring</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Built offline-first interface to configure assembly-line jobs and control tools & machinery over WebSockets and LocalStorage</li>
    <li>Deployed Node-Red backend on Raspberry PI connected to station Windows computer</li>
    <li>Built client-side performance tracker averaging the time to assemble one project in a job</li>
    <li>Created custom node-red modules for smoother synchronization with Fanuc robots</li>
    <li>Wrote Station Service request tool to allow operators to order more parts or tool servicing</li>
    <li>This project expanded on the HVFIR project above by allowing management to configure and validate jobs manually without needing the MySQL database</li>
</ul>
