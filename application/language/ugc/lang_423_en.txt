<p>I have a passion for music, art, culture and education. To diversify my exposure and knowledge of these, I live between San Francisco, California, Bogot√°, Colombia, and the Hawaiian Island of Kauai.</p>

<p>Combined with skills in an array of computer technologies as well as broad experiences in business development, my focus is helping companies develop their own systems and finding strategies for expansion throughout South America.</p>

<p>Wherever you are in the world, If you have a product you are also passionate about and feel I could be of service, I love a good excuse to travel and will generally assume the cost for serious inquiries. To do so, I am always available via email: <span class='alink'>eat@taylormadetraffic.com</span>, google voice: <span class='alink'>1-415-300-0834</span> or, skype: <span class='alink'>skye_eli</span></p>
