        between languages has never been an obstacle and for a clearer chronology of my work visit taylormadetraffic.com/eli.
        Overall, 20 years of debugging and designing systems has given me a strong appreciation for problem-solving,
        test-driven development, and agile methodologies</p>

    <p>I am also applying for this role with Dick's Sporting Goods because I'm a passionate athlete and hope to always
