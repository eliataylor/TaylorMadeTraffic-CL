    <p>As a Full Stack Engineer with extensive experience leading distributed teams across the globe in both technical and product oriented roles, I bring a
        unique blend of
        technical expertise and leadership to the table.
        My hands-on coding experience spans multiple tech stacks, and fluency in Spanish and English has proven
        valuable when working with teams across South America.</p>

    <p>I've organized my experience below to highlight the languages listed in your job description. However, syntax
        has never been an obstacle and for a clearer chronology of my work please visit <b>taylormadetraffic.com/eli/cv</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Overall, from over 20 years of debugging and designing systems, I've grown a strong appreciation for problem-solving,
        test-driven development, and agile methodologies.</p>

I have been building scalable mobile applications with React Native since 2019. Leveraging React
Nativeâ€™s versatility, I focus on creating seamless cross-platform experiences that balance
performance and user-centric design. Some noteworthy features include efficient background

location tracking, audio recording, QR/barcode scanning, offline-first functionality, picture-in-
picture mode, and robust authentication systems (email/password, SMS, OAuth, and MFA). I hope

to bring my expertise to your team to continue building impactful solutions.

I was one of the first to do i.


Remote work has been fun, but did I miss out working with bigger teams?

I love bringing products to life.



As I'm paying for that now, I wonder how other's who freelanced while exploring the world keep up to date.

I was applying for a job late last night and got introduced to FonziAI.
I didn't know expect that at all.
