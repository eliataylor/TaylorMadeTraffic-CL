    <p>As a Full Stack Engineer with extensive experience leading distributed teams across the globe in both technical and product oriented roles, I bring a
        unique blend of
        technical expertise and leadership to the table.
        My hands-on coding experience spans multiple tech stacks, and fluency in Spanish and English has proven
        valuable when working with teams across South America.</p>

    <p>I've organized my experience below to highlight the languages listed in your job description. However, syntax
        has never been an obstacle and for a clearer chronology of my work please visit <b>taylormadetraffic.com/eli/cv</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Overall, from over 20 years of debugging and designing systems, I've grown a strong appreciation for problem-solving,
        test-driven development, and agile methodologies.</p>

        <p>Although I've grown strong expertise with several tech stacks, I mostly enjoy working closer to the product from the API to the front-end with TypeScript and ReactJS</p>
