    <p>As a Full Stack Engineer with extensive experience leading distributed teams across the globe in both technical and product oriented roles, I bring a
        unique blend of
        technical expertise and leadership to the table.
        My hands-on coding experience spans multiple tech stacks, and fluency in Spanish and English has proven
        valuable when working with teams across South America.</p>

    <p>I've organized my experience below to highlight the languages listed in your job description. However, syntax
        has never been an obstacle and for a clearer chronology of my work please visit <b>taylormadetraffic.com/eli/cv</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Overall, from over 20 years of debugging and designing systems, I've grown a strong appreciation for problem-solving,
        test-driven development, and agile methodologies.</p>

You made Healthline a great environment Niraj.


Special Thanks to you Niraj and the whole Healthline team :) Navigator coulda been huuuge!

    Over the past few years I've done a lot with computer vision, screen sharing, and automating image & video effects with ffmpeg, imagemagick and OpenCV.

    Although I have also trained my own custom models image detection models for PickupMVP, I mostly have focused on building advanced annotation tools with version controls to track changes to image tagging.

<p> I've used websockets for persistent connections on the Tesla assembly line.
    I've used HLS to authenticate and serve audio/video content with OAuth2 bearer tokens.
    I've used ffmpeg to automate slow motion, pan and zoom video effects.
    I've used OpenCV and ImageMagick to automate augmentation of limited image data before AI training and validation.
    I've used Github Actions for continuous deployments starting with end-to-end Cypress tests and ending with Docker compose builds. And I've been using ReactJS since 2017 with Redux or Context and strong TypeScripting on both client and server side data structures.
</p>

<p>All around this sounds like a great fit and interesting opportunity. I hope you'll feel the same and let me know what else I can present to make the case.</p>
