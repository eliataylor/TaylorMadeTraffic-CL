        <p>As a Full Stack Engineer with extensive experience leading distributed teams across the globe in both
            technical and product oriented roles, I bring a
            unique blend of
            technical expertise and leadership to the table.
            My hands-on coding experience spans multiple tech stacks, and fluency in Spanish and English has proven
            valuable when working with teams across South America.</p>

        <p>I've organized my experience below to highlight the languages listed in your job description. However, syntax
            has never been an obstacle and for a clearer chronology of my work please visit <b>taylormadetraffic.com/eli/cv</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, from over 20 years of debugging and designing systems, I've grown a strong appreciation for
            problem-solving,
            test-driven development, and agile methodologies.</p>

<?php if ($this->input->get_post('intro') === 'reactnative'): ?>

    <p>I have been building scalable mobile applications with React Native since 2019. Leveraging React
        Native's versatility, I focus on creating seamless cross-platform experiences that balance
        performance and user-centric design. Some noteworthy features include efficient background location tracking,
        audio recording, QR/barcode scanning, offline-first functionality, picture-in-
        picture mode, and robust authentication systems (email/password, SMS, OAuth, and MFA).</p>

    <p>I've also played a major role in the APIs and architecture for all these apps. You can review more of that work
        at <b>taylormadetraffic.com/eli</b>.</p>

            With over 20 years designing, developing, and debugging applications, I can hit the ground running and make an impact from day one.

    <p>With over 20 years of experience designing, developing, and debugging applications, I can hit the ground running and make an impact from day one.

        Having witnessed the raise and fall of many technologies, I bring all the modern benefits of AI and advanced IDEs in my work, but ensure core architecture and best practices remain grounded in my expertise.

        I love working independently to achieve goals and can also follow direction with precision, always in line with team objectives.

    Although extremely versed in several backend stacks, I mostly enjoy working closer to the interface and product experience
        with TypeScript and ReactJS.

        I'm well versed in literally every technology listed on this job description.

        However, I'm mostly interested in this opportunity because of all the mobility I regained doing classes with Dylan Werner on Alo Moves.

    Remote work has been fun, but did I miss out working with bigger teams?

    I love bringing products to life.


    As I'm paying for that now, I wonder how other's who freelanced while exploring the world keep up to date.
