            Through those years, Cypher and Flexible Assembly Systems have remained my most consistent clients. Their
            recommendations on my LinkedIn attest to my work ethic and customer satisfaction. As for code quality, I
            approach every project with the best practices of test-driven development, while pen-testing my servers and
            interfaces for security and performance under high traffic.</p>
        <p>
            In parallel, I have dedicated time to building proprietary and passion projects - PickupMVP, Track Authority, and Objects/Actions - that have significantly enriched my professional skill set. These projects have allowed me to explore cutting-edge technologies like TensorFlow for computer vision and OpenAI for LLM driven applications. This work has not only fueled my personal growth but also directly contributed to the innovative solutions Iâ€™ve implemented for my clients. By staying at the forefront of emerging tech trends, I ensure my work is both forward-thinking and impactful.
