<p>Welcome. My name is Eli.</p>

<p>I love coffee, hate soggy cereal, and am flexible with just about everything else.</p>

<p>I also love building applications around music, art, and education. However, even in developing the driest of products - i.e. automated healthcare advertising - I have found great fun in problem solving and strategy.</p>

<p>Currently, my most permanent address is in Bogota, Colombia. However, you can often find me in Hawaii or my hometown, San Francisco, California. If you're somewhere else and have an exciting project that could use my love, I also love a good excuse to travel and am would love to start the conversation via email <span class="alink">eat@taylormadetraffic.com</span>, phone <span class="alink">1-415-300-0834</span> or skype <span class="alink">skye_eli</span>.</p>

<p>- Eitherway, I LOVE YOU TOO!</p>
